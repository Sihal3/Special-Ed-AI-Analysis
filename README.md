# Special-Ed-AI-Analysis

Essentially, with this project, I'm trying to use Tensorflow neural networks to analyze data from special education students to predict the effectiveness of various learning accommodations they are given. 
Right now, I don't have real data, so I'm generating my own randomly, with a few trends, in the Datagen file, then training the model on it in the Compiler file.
Check the formal write-up titled "Education Project Brief" for more information.
