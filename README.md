# Special-Ed-AI-Analysis

With this project, I'm trying to use Tensorflow artificial neural networks to analyze data from special education students to predict the effectiveness of various learning accommodations they are given. 
I'm currently working on applying this to real student data, but that's a work in progress.
For now, I'm generating my own randomly, with a few trends, in the Datagen file, then training the model on it in the Compiler.ipynb file.
To try it yourself, use the cleaned-up Release.ipynb file.
Check the formal write-up titled "Education Project Brief", or the full paper titled "Special Ed Paper" for more information.
